Which tickets can I refund?
Flexible tickets (Off-Peak, Super Off-Peak and Anytime tickets)
These types of tickets can be refunded online for a fee. 
You have 28 days from expiry of the ticket to request a refund and return your ticket. If you have a mobile ticket and it has already been activated, you can no longer claim a refund on that journey.

Advance Single ticket
Advance Single tickets cannot be refunded but they can be changed.
Changes are only allowed for a different time/date of travel, so you need to stick to the same departure and arrival stations.  Visit this page for more information on changing.

SplitSave
Similar rules apply to a combination of tickets. 
The Flexible tickets can be refunded. The Advance Single tickets can only be changed.  However, if you have a combination of Advance and Flexible then all the tickets can be changed.  

Refund fees
If you originally got your ticket by calling our contact centre then we charge a set £5 fee.
For tickets bought online or using our apps, the refund fee is based on the value of the ticket that is being cancelled. The breakdown of refund fees for tickets bought online or using our apps is as follows -

Ticket Value Refund Fee
Up to £1.99 No fee
£2 to £2.99 £1.00
£3 to £3.99 £1.50
£4 to £4.99 £2.00
£5 to £5.99 £3.00
£6 to £6.99 £4.00
>£7 £5.00
Refunds for delayed or cancelled trains
Refund for a cancelled train
If your train is cancelled, you can use your existing ticket to travel on the next available service...
Advance Singles – hop on the next available train with the same train operator.
Flexible tickets – such as Off-Peak and Anytime tickets offer flexibility and you can travel at various times of the day.
Remember to check the conditions of your ticket in case you can only travel with a certain operator/route.

If you can't take the next train or decide not to travel, you’ll be entitled to a refund.

The quickest and easiest way to refund your ticket is to do it online. Login to My Bookings, select your booking, and click on refund tickets.

Compensation for a delayed train
If your train was delayed but you still managed to complete your journey then a ticket refund is not available. However the train operators themselves do offer compensation. Please see this article on how to claim compensation. 
How to request a refund online
If you have an account:
Find your booking on our website in My Bookings or within our App under 'My Tickets'
Select 'Refund my tickets'

If you don’t have an account:
Find your confirmation email and click ‘Manage booking’.
Follow the steps above to request a refund
When will I get my refund?
Refunds can take an average of 3-5 days to process.  You can check the status of your refund in your account.

Here's a guide to what the statuses mean.
Refunded/ Refund Approved - You've done everything you need to and your refund is on the way back to you, it will appear in your account within 5 days.
Refund Processing/ Refund - Action Required – Before we can process your refund we may need you to return your tickets.
Refund Rejected– We’re unable to refund your tickets. This could be because you've scanned your eticket or activated your Mobile Ticket. 
My card has expired
We only refund the card that was originally used to make the booking – this is to make sure that the refund goes to the right place and avoids any problems.  If your card has expired then normally this won’t make any difference to money being refunded.

If your account is closed and the refund still isn't appearing in your account after 15 days, please contact your card issuer. They'll be holding the funds for you and will be able to arrange a transfer to your new account. If your card issuer has confirmed that the refund funds have been sent back to us, please obtain an ARN number from them to allow us to trace the returned refund.

Changing a UK train ticket
Quick changes – for direct access to changes and refunds for a particular booking, find your confirmation email and click ‘Manage booking’.  Can't find the email? Search your inbox for an email from auto-confirm@info.thetrainline.com.
If you have an account, login to view all your bookings in one place. 

Advance Single tickets
Changes are only allowed for a different time/date of travel, so you need to stick to the same departure and arrival stations.
 The simplest way to amend your tickets is online via My Booking.
For eticket bookings you pay the difference between your original ticket and new ticket, plus a change fee. If your new ticket is cheaper than the original, then you only pay the fee but the difference will not be refunded.
For mobile and paper tickets we refund you whichever ticket is the lowest priced between your original or new ticket. From this we deduct a change fee based on the value of the ticket.
For more info about exchange fees, visit our dedicated page.
Off-Peak, Super Off-Peak and Anytime tickets
These types of ticket can’t be changed, sorry. But, they are refundable so you can cancel these and buy the new ones you want. Check out our FAQ for cancelling bookings.
 Just to remind you that these tickets are flexible tickets, so it’s worth first double checking to see if they are valid for the new time or date you want to travel.

Can part of a ticket be refunded?
Advance tickets

Advance tickets are only sold as Singles and are non refundable. 

Flexible tickets 

Anytime, Off-Peak and Super Off-Peak can be bought as Single or Returns.
Single tickets - each is refundable. 
Return tickets - are refundable where both directions are unused. 
Return tickets - only one direction of travel is used:
If only the outbound leg is used, the return part is refundable*
If the return leg is used, the outbound is not refundable.
 * the refund you are due is not always 50% of the full ticket cost, the refund is calculated by subtracting the cost of an equivalent single ticket from the price paid, meaning there’s not always a refundable value remaining. These part refunds are not available online so speak to our support team who can explain the breakdown of your refund.  

All other refunds can be requested by using your online account or in My Tickets on the app.

Can I change the name on the ticket?
If you’re travelling with an eticket in mainland Europe or on a Eurostar service, you must enter the name of the traveller at the time of the booking. Most carriers only allow the person named on the ticket to use it, and once the ticket has been purchased, we cannot change it.
 If you’ve just made an obvious spelling mistake, then you shouldn’t have too much to worry about. Bring along your ID and explain the error to the ticket inspector, it’s still up to them whether they accept you ticket, but if it’s clear you are the intended traveller you shouldn’t have a problem.

If your passport or ID is in your maiden name but your ticket is in your married name, just bring a copy of your marriage certificate with you when you travel. There’s no need to make any changes to your booking or let us know in advance.

iryo
It is possible to change the name on your ticket by contacting us. Please note that changing fees may apply.
Italo
It is possible to change the name on your ticket for a fee, you will need to go to the carrier’s website to do so.
OUIGO
OUIGO France and OUIGO Spain
It is possible to change the name on your ticket, you will need to go to the carrier’s website to do so. Please note that changing fees will apply.
 
Renfe
Premium fare, we can change the name on your ticket. You must contact us through this form. (Please note this doesn’t apply to Renfe-SNCF trains)
Trenitalia
Trenitalia tickets for national trains, Frecciarossa, Frecciargento, Frecciabianca, Intercity day, Eurocity Italy-Switzerland (limited to the internal route), Intercity night and tickets for regional trains are nominative. We remind you that, at the checkpoint, you must present a valid identity document together with the ticket.

The name can be changed for free (and limitlessly up until the departure time of the train) on tickets valid for travel on national trains, Frecciarossa, Frecciargento, Frecciabianca, Intercity day, Intercity night, and Eurocity Italy-Switzerland (limited to the domestic route). The request can be made:
Directly on your account (“manage my booking” and then “edit passenger details”), or from the confirmation email (“manage my booking” and then “edit passenger details”) if you don’t have an account.
by Contacting us.
at Trenitalia ticket offices at the station.
By accessing the reservation on Trenitalia's website.

The name cannot be changed on tickets valid for travel on regional trains. To allow another passenger to travel, it is therefore necessary to purchase a new ticket with the name of the person who will make the trip (if the conditions of sale allow it, you can cancel the ticket with the wrong name). If the ticket was purchased by adding the CartaFRECCIA, the ticket can only be used by the cardholder.
 Specific cases on name changes requests:
In the case of travel solutions consisting of several national trains in conjunction (e.g.: IC train + FR train; FR train + FR train) - the name change can be requested for all trains, up to departure of the first train (it is not possible to request a name change for just one train).
Same day return: in the case of same day return offers, the name change can be requested globally up to the departure of the outbound train (it is not possible to request the name change for just one train).
National trains + Regional trains: For travel solutions that include a combination of national trains and regional trains, it is not possible to request a name change.
 WESTbahn
They do not require a named person to travel and don't display a name on the ticket.


If someone else would like to travel, they'll need to book a new ticket.If you are just looking to book a ticket for someone else please visit our How do I buy a ticket for someone else? help page.

First Class Service Declassified
A number of train operators offer the option to purchase First Class tickets to allow you to enjoy extra leg room, free Wi-Fi and on some services, complimentary food and drink.

There are however occasions where the train operators may have to declassify their first class carriages. This could be for a number of reasons but primarily when services become extremely busy. In the event of disruption for example, opening up first class to all passengers regardless of ticket type, can help reduce overcrowding.

While this can be disappointing if you’ve paid for a First Class ticket, the train operators will provide a refund to cover the fare difference between first and standard class (based on same ticket type).  Please contact the Train Operator direct to request this refund. 

If you’re unsure who you travelled with, take a look at your ticket details in My Bookings on our website or 'My tickets' on our app. Alternatively, the train operator will be displayed within your booking confirmation email.

 * Compensations below are all based on a single ticket. Return tickets are half or compensated for your affected journey. For more in-depth information on this go direct to Train Operators (TOC) website by clicking on the TOC below.


Why you might not get compensation
If your delay was because of a planned disruption, or an emergency timetable being used, then compensation’s not on the cards unfortunately. You might not be paid compensation for delays caused by things outside of the rail industry’s control either. But, each company might have a different policy, so it’s better to check with them direct. For a quick guide at single ticket compensations please see the table below.

Do I get a ticket for the part of my journey that is by bus or tube?
This article is if your journey is in the UK.
If your journey requires you to transfer trains between two stations then whilst searching for a trip we will recommend the best option -
If only a short hop then it may be best to walk if you can.  
If travel is between stations in London then Tube might be best, in which case this ticket will be sold to you as part of the overall cost of the trip.  
If between stations outside of London then a bus could be best - we will only sell you the train tickets so you will need to buy your bus tickets separately.
There is one specific transfer shown that we know can be misleading.  If part of your journey is from Edinburgh Airport to another station then sometimes we recommend bus or tram, but don't always make it obvious that you need to make your own way and buy your own ticket.  We rely on industry data to show these recommendations and in this case it's not entirely accurate.

Do I have enough time to transfer between trains?
Don’t worry, if you’re buying tickets for a route where you’ll need to change train, transfer time is taken into consideration. Transfer times are rail industry standard and are individually calculated for each station.

If you think you’ll need more time to get to your connecting train you can always change your departure time, or book each part of your trip separately.

Mobile Tickets: Alternative routes involving the London Underground
Mobile Tickets and etickets aren’t valid for the London Underground so if you book a journey with us that travels through London on the tube, we won’t offer you this option.
 However, if your ticket says ‘any route permitted’, you’ll have the flexibility to travel to your destination on a different route to the one you originally chose when you booked.

Please bear in mind that if you’re travelling with a Mobile Ticket or eticket and decide to take a route that goes via a London Underground station, your Mobile Ticket or eticket won’t be valid for this part of the journey. You’ll need to buy a separate ticket for the London Underground, or use an Oyster Card or contactless payment option.

What happens if I miss my connection due to a delay?
Travelling in the UK
If you miss your next train because a previous connecting train service was delayed, you will be able to travel on the next train provided by the train operator (if the entire journey is booked under one ticket). We recommend speaking to a member of staff on the delayed train or at the connecting station to confirm this or any other options that may be available to you.

Travelling with Eurostar:
If you miss your Eurostar because of a disruption on your first train in the UK, speak to a Eurostar staff member; they should be able to assist you in getting on the next available train.
 If you miss your connecting Railteam train due to a disruption on your Eurostar, talk to a staff member to confirm the delay or cancellation of your Eurostar train. They will assist you in getting on the next available connecting train for free.

Travelling in mainland Europe
General advice is available below, but we always recommend speaking to a member of staff on the delayed train or at the connecting station to get specific advice for your situation.

Connecting to the same carrier
If your connecting train is with the same carrier as the delayed train you will be able to travel on the next available train to your destination. Speak to the train staff to find out if you can board the next train with your existing ticket as you may need to exchange the ticket for a new one, free of charge.

Please note: Renfe only guarantees the connection between its services if the following conditions are met:
The connection does not involve Cercanías or Ancho Métrico services.
The theoretical arrival time of the first train and the departure time of the second train have a time interval equal to or greater than 60 minutes (for transfers within the same station) or equal to or greater than 90 minutes (for transfers between two different stations).
The station where the connection is made is located on Spanish territory.
Connecting to a different carrier
If you are travelling by high-speed trains and your connection is between 2 different carriers, then you could benefit from:
 HOTNAT guarantee (“Hop On The Next Available Train”)
Eligible criteria:
Missed a connection between 2 high-speed trains from the Railteam alliance: DB (ICE), SNCF (TGV), Eurostar, TGV Lyria.
AND
Your connection departs from one of these stations.
 France France & Belgium Germany
Paris Gare du Nord Lille Europe Station Frankfurt Main Station
Paris Gare de l’Est Lyon Part Dieu Cologne Main Station
Paris Gare de Lyon Strasbourg Offenburg
Paris Montparnasse Brussels Midi-Zuid Stuttgart
 AJC (Agreement on Journey Continuation)
The Agreement on Journey Continuation (AJC) is an agreement between 15 European rail operators to allow passengers on international trains to catch the next available train at no extra cost if they miss their connection.
 The 15 operators involved are:
 SNCF (France)
BLS (Switzerland)
SZ (Slovenia)
SNCB (Belgium)
SBB/CFF/FFS (Switzerland)
NS (Netherlands)
Trenitalia (Italy)
CD (Czech Republic)
ZSSK (Slovakia)
Renfe (Spain)
DSB (Denmark)
SJ (Sweden)
Deutsche Bahn (Germany)
ÖBB (Austria)
CFL (Luxembourg)
 If you miss your connection on an international journey because your previous train was delayed, you should go to the ticket office of your connection station (the station where you should have boarded on the international train you missed).
The procedure is the same for all operators who have signed up to the agreement.
 Other carriers and stations
If your journey is not covered go to My Bookings to check if the flexibility of your ticket means you can go on a different train. As always we recommend speaking to a member of staff on the delayed train for further advice.

Can I amend my seat reservation? 

The seat you are given when buying an Advance Single ticket cannot be changed. Seats for flexible tickets such as Anytime, Off-Peak and Super Off-Peak can be. Please follow the process below to amend your seats. 

Log in to your account and open the ticket which you would like to amend. When your ticket is open you will see this page below.
Please click on the change date/time option to amend your seats. Next you will be asked to select the the journey you would like to change

Once you have clicked continue you will then be asked to search for a new date/time. If you would only like to change your seat and not your date/time then please just search the same date and time as you had previously chosen and click find new journey. 

Next you will see a list of new times for the date you have chosen and next to these times you will see a Reserve button. If there is no Reserve button then this means that the service is fully booked or a non reservable service. Once you have decided on the new time and there are still reservable seats then please click the reserve button.


Seat reservations for group bookings
If you make a seat reservation for a booking of more than one person, our system will choose the best selection of seats from those available. You might get some seat numbers that don’t look like they’re together, but this might be because they’re sat around a table. We’ll always try and match your preferences, but at times it’s not always possible. Don’t worry though, many long-distance train routes have carriages that can’t be reserved, so you’re likely to find a seat on the day.
Travelling in Mainland Europe
Whether you can reserve a seat depends on the carrier you are travelling. When you make a booking online you will be shown the seat reservations available for you chosen train. 

Seat reservations fall into one of the following categories -

Free seat reservation allocated at the time of booking
If you require a reservation you will be allocated one at the time of booking. Many carriers allow you to specify seating preferences, fill these in when prompted during the booking flow and we’ll do our best to provide a seat meeting those preferences.

Purchase a seat reservation at the time of booking
Some carriers do not pre-allocate you a seat reservation, instead they give you the option of purchasing one at the time of booking. To book simply select a reservation from the comfort options whilst selecting your ticket type. Add seating preferences when prompted during the booking flow and we’ll do our best to provide a seat meeting those preferences.

Upgrade to a premium seat at the time of booking
Some carriers allocate you a seat reservation but also give you the option of purchasing an upgrade to a Premium seat. The perks of these upgrades vary depending for each carrier, examples are a comfier seat, drinks and snacks, wifi and newspapers. To book simply select a Premium reservation from the comfort options whilst selecting you ticket type.

Non reservable train
Some carriers don’t provide seat reservations on all or some of their trains. This is common on regional trains, shorter routes and during peak travel times on commuter routes. On these trains you can sit in any vacant seat in the class your ticket is booked for.

Amending seat reservations
Once your ticket is booked and the seat reservations has been made, we are unable to amend it.
 Purchasing a seat reservation after booking
 Some carriers allow you to add a seat reservation after booking. You will need to go to the carrier website directly and enter the details of your trip. If the chosen train allows you to reserve a seat, you will have the option to pay the fees.

For CFF, it’s here.
For Deutsche Bahn, it’s this way.
For ÖBB, it will be this way.

Can I take my pet on the train?
The rules for taking pets on board differ for each Carrier and Train Operating Company (TOC), so it's best to check before booking your trip.

National Rail (UK)
Small pets, like dogs and cats can travel with you on the train for free, as long as they don’t annoy other passengers, or put them in danger. You can bring a maximum of two animals per passenger, but you’ll have to keep them on a lead, or comfortable in a closed basket, cage or pet carrier that’s secure, so they can’t escape. If you’re planning on bringing more than two pets, you’ll need to check with the TOC directly.

Even if they might do it at home, your pets aren’t allowed to climb on the seats. They’re for paying passengers only.

If you’re asking about taking your pets on a Sleeper Service, click here for more information.

Deutsche Bahn (Germany)
Small Pets - pets up to the size of a domestic cat travel free of charge. They must travel in a carrier that will fit under the seat or on the shelf above.

Large Pets – larger pets can travel on trains if you purchase a special pet fare,they must travel on a leash and be wearing a muzzle. Pet tickets should be purchased with Deutsche Bahn directly.

Guide dogs travel free of charge and are not required to wear a muzzle.

What do I need to know about Eurostar check in?
Catching the Eurostar is a little different from catching a normal train, as you’ll have to pass through customs before you can board. With that in mind, we’d always recommend you giving yourself extra time to allow for any hold ups.

To check in, you’ll need –
When you arrive at the ticket gates, simply scan the barcode on your paper ticket or on your mobile. You need to scan each ticket individually – even the kids’. 
A valid passport or identity card – even children and babies will need one.  
You don’t need to check in luggage, so long as you’re within the allowance and can carry it yourself.  

When does check in for Eurostar open?

Check in opens between one and one and a half hours before departure and closes 30 minutes before departure. But, you must be there 45 minutes before departure to make sure you get through customs and pass the necessary checks before boarding. If you turn up within 30 minutes of departure (10 minutes if you hold a Eurostar card or Business Premier Flexi ticket), you might not be allowed to board.
 At the weekend or peak holiday times customs at all stations can be busier, we’d strongly recommend getting to the station at least an hour before departure too. It’s never nice to feel rushed, so the more time you have to spare, the more relaxed a journey you’ll have.

How to book assistance or check accessibility for disabled passengers
If you or someone you’re travelling with will need help with things like getting on and off the train, we’d recommend booking assistance as far in advance as possible. 

You can book help, arrange a seat reservation or wheelchair space and find out about facilities and accessibility directly with the Train Operating Company (TOC)/ Carrier you are travelling with. 

Click on your TOC/ Carrier below to find contact details. If you’re not sure who your TOC / Carrier is take a look at your ticket’s details in "My bookings" on our website or "My tickets" on our app. 

For journeys in the EU, the Carrier should also inform you whether you need to notify any other Carriers or stations involved in your journey.

Rail Passenger Rights
Rail Passenger Rights for travel in the UK
Your rights as a train passenger in the UK
 Your legal rights as a passenger when travelling by train in the UK are set out in the Rail Passenger Rights Regulation 2007 (EC) No 1371/2007 (RPRR).
 The RPRR covers you for things like delayed or cancelled journeys and grants you passenger legal rights.
 We’ve summarised the main points below:
 The basic set of rules
Rights for passengers with reduced mobility
Passenger rights to information
Bicycle carriage
Disruptions
Compensation
Assistance in cases of disruption
Complaints
 The basic set of rules
 Under the RPRR, all train operating companies (TOCs) must:
Offer point-to-point tickets, through tickets, and seat reservations
Comply with the liability requirement for passengers and their luggage, including any obligations to passengers’ personal security
Offer a minimum level of insurance for a train company
Give transport rights to passengers with reduced mobility, as well as details on accessibility of train services
TOCs, as well as ticket providers like Trainline, must inform passengers of their rights, outlined below:
 Rights for passengers with reduced mobility
 TOCs must give passengers with reduced mobility:
access services
information on the accessibility of train services, upon request, as well as assistance boarding, whilst on board, and disembarking a train free of charge. Customers must request this assistance at least 48 hours before it’s needed.
TOCs must also accept responsibility for any loss (total or partial) of, or damage to, mobility equipment or other specific equipment used by persons with reduced mobility caused by the company.
 For more info, see our Accessibility FAQ.
 Passenger rights to information
 Before and during your train journey, you’re entitled to details about:
The fastest and cheapest journey options
Connecting services
Accessibility and bicycle transport
Seating (smoking and non-smoking compartments and any sleeping carriages)
Ticket classes (e.g. First Class)
Disruptions and delays (including next trains and estimated arrival times)
Onboard services (including toilets and refreshments)
Lost luggage and complaints
Any security considerations
 Bicycle carriage
 TOCs may (at their discretion) let you bring your bike on the train, provided they’re easy to handle and don’t cause issues to other passengers. You may need to reserve a space for your bike before travelling.
 Disruptions
 If you’re delayed 60 minutes or more, you’re entitled to either:
A full refund for the affected part of your journey; or
Continue your journey at the earliest opportunity, or at a more convenient later date.
 Compensation
 In case you continue your journey, despite a delay, you’re entitled to compensation.
 The minimum compensation for delays is:
25% of the ticket price for a delay of 60 to 119 minutes
50% of the ticket price for a delay of at least 120 minutes
 Your compensation will be repaid to the same method you bought your tickets with, within one month from the date you claim.
 Assistance in cases of disruption
 TOCs must inform you of train delays and cancellations as soon as information is available.
 If you’re affected by any delay of at least 60 minutes, the TOC must offer you free refreshments in reasonable relation to the waiting time. If the delay keeps you overnight, you’re also entitled to a free hotel (or similar) including transport between the train station and your accommodation.
 If the train is blocked on the track, the TOC must arrange transport from the train to the station, or to an alternative departure point or to the final destination of the service, where and when physically possible. If the train service can’t be continued, the TOC must organise alternative transport as soon as possible.
 Complaints
 TOCs must generally respond to any complaints within one month. If longer, they’ll need to tell you when you can expect a reply – within a period of less than three months from the date of your complaint.
 Rail Passenger Rights for travel in the EU
Your rights as a train passenger in the European Union
 Your legal rights as a passenger when travelling by train in the EU are set out in the Rail Passenger Rights Regulation 2021 No 2021/782 (RPRR).
 The RPRR covers you for things like delayed or cancelled journeys and grants you passenger legal rights.
 You can read a full outline of your EU rail passenger rights, but we’ve summarised the main points below:
 The basic set of rules
Rights for passengers with reduced mobility
Rights to passenger information
Bicycle carriage
Disruptions
Compensation
Assistance in cases of disruption
Complaints
Note – Scope, Exemptions and Additional Schemes

 Bicycle carriage
 Unless a TOC has a specific restriction, you may bring your bike on the train, provided they’re easy to handle and don’t cause issues to other passengers. You may need to reserve a space for your bike before travelling.

For more information on how to reserve a space for a bike, and any restrictions TOCs may have on when you can bring your bike on a train, see our Bikes FAQ.
 Disruptions
 If you’re delayed 60 minutes or more, you’re entitled to either:
A full refund for the affected part of your journey; or
Continue your journey at the earliest opportunity, or at a more convenient later date.
 Compensation
 In case you continue your journey, despite a delay, you’re entitled to compensation.
 The minimum compensation for delays is:
25% of the ticket price for a delay of 60 to 119 minutes
50% of the ticket price for a delay of at least 120 minutes
 Your compensation will be repaid to the same method you bought your tickets with, within one month from the date you claim.
 Assistance in cases of disruption
 TOCs must inform you of train delays and cancellations as soon as information is available.
 If you’re affected by any delay of at least 60 minutes, the TOC must offer you free refreshments in reasonable relation to the waiting time, if they are available or can be reasonably supplied. If the delay keeps you overnight, you’re also entitled to a free hotel (or similar) including transport between the train station and your accommodation.
 If the train is blocked on the track, the TOC must arrange transport from the train to the station, or to an alternative departure point or to the final destination of the service, where and when physically possible. If the train service can’t be continued, the TOC must organise alternative transport as soon as possible.
 Complaints
 TOCs must generally respond to any complaints within one month. If longer, they’ll need to tell you when you can expect a reply – within a period of less than three months from the date of your complaint.
 Note – Scope, Exemptions and Additional Schemes
 These rights apply only to journeys in the European Union. Some European Union Member States may choose to exclude some of your rights under the RPRR. In this case, you may not be entitled to the same level of protection as you would be under the RPRR. This will most likely affect you when it comes to your right to compensation.
 The law allows member states to apply exemptions to domestic rail services, urban, suburban and regional services, and rail services of which a significant part is operated outside the European Union. Although many states have not granted exemptions, please do keep in mind that some trips are not covered.
 That said, you may be able to benefit from a local compensation scheme, either in place or on top of the European rail passenger rights. Whether you can benefit from them may depend on the type of train you use and the type of ticket you hold.

Do I need my booking confirmation to travel?
Is a confirmation email needed to make the trip? 

No, the booking confirmation contains some useful travel information, but it isn’t the ticket. 

If you still want the confirmation email then check the junk/spam folder for an email from 
auto-confirm@info.thetrainline.com just in case it’s got caught in there. 

I can’t find the booking confirmation email, what information do I need? 

Most important is the ticket and whether you have a mobile ticket in the app, an eticket to present on your screen, or a ticket reference to use for collecting from a machine, all this is available on our website under My Bookings or within our App under 'My Tickets'

How do I print my Eurostar ticket?
To print your Eurostar tickets you’ll need your reference number, which can be found in your booking confirmation email. If you’ve lost the email, don’t worry, you can easily find your reference number in My booking/My account on our website or our app.

Where you print your Eurostar tickets depends on where your trip is departing from. But, whichever station you’re catching the Eurostar from, you’ll need to make sure you’ve printed your tickets at least 45 minutes beforehand - this gives you time to check in and board the train. You’ll also need your ID to check in.
Departures from Lille or Marne-la-Vallée
At the station, head to an SNCF self-service ticket machine and follow the instructions on the screen for collecting tickets.
Enter your booking reference number and confirm.
Make sure you collect all your tickets, as you can only print them once.
Departures from Brussels
Either go to the Railtours office in the Eurostar concourse, or use the Eurostar self-service ticket machines.
Have your ID and your booking reference handy.
Make sure you collect all your tickets, as you can only print them once.
Departures from all other Eurostar stations (London St Pancras International, Calais etc)
Head to the Eurostar check-in area and find a self-service ticket machine.
Follow the instructions on the screen and enter your booking reference.
Make sure you collect all your tickets, as you can only print them once.
You don’t need your payment card to collect your tickets, so there’s no need to insert it into the machine or show it to staff. If you’re having any problems with printing your tickets from a machine, or you’d just prefer to do things in person, you can have them printed by staff at the Eurostar ticket desks. But, be aware that you might wait in line for a while.

Can I move my Mobile Ticket to another device?
You can only download your Mobile Ticket to one device, so make sure you download it to whichever device you’re planning to take with you when you travel. If you’ve already downloaded the ticket but now are travelling with a different device then you can move it.

How to move your Mobile Ticket to a different device

You can move you ticket to another mobile in just a few easy steps-

1. Find the ticket in the My tickets section of the app and select 'View tickets'
2. Move the tickets-
If you have the Android app tap the menu in the top right corner (3 dots) and choose 'Move tickets'
If you the IOS app tap options in the top left corner and choose 'Move tickets'
3. Open our app in the device you’d like to move your tickets to, log in to your trainline account and then download your tickets to your new device.

If you need to transfer the ticket to another traveller, please ask them to download the app and login to their account, if they are a new customer ask them to create an account. Once they've done this please contact us and we will move the ticket to their account. 

Just so you know, before you travel you need to activate the ticket on your device. However, once activated you can no longer move, change, or refund the ticket so it's best to wait until just before travel before activating.

Groups travelling with a Mobile Ticket?
When you travel as a group with a mobile ticket, all your tickets will be available to download in the 'My Tickets' section on the lead passenger's phone.

A few things to remember before you travel -
The whole group must travel together on the same train.
Meet at the station before the train leaves and go through the barriers together.
Make sure you sit close together on the train so show the inspector you ticket.

Fees
It's good to know exactly what you're paying for. So, we've answered the most common questions about our fees below.

Journeys booked when you’re in the UK
Why do you charge a booking fee?
 We know it sounds cliché, but these fees really do go towards improving our products and services. We want to give you great value and hassle-free travel by rail and coach. It’s pretty much our thing. We keep a close eye on our fees to make sure we're always putting your money to the best use.
 Do I always have to pay a booking fee?
 No! That’s the short answer. Here's the long answer:
If you’re in the UK and booking via our app on the day of travel, there’s no booking fee.
For all other journeys in the UK, a booking fee applies. It’s based on your chosen journey, the ticket price, and when you’re booking. This fee will vary between a minimum of 59p and a maximum of £2.79.
Important note for anyone using a foreign currency card to pay: Different booking fees may apply.
 Purchasing a cross-border journey or a journey in another country? Different booking fees may apply.
 Why do some customers see different fees?
 The booking fee you pay depends on:
Your chosen journey
Ticket price
When and where you are booking from.
Most of the time, the booking fee will be between 59p and £2.79 if you’re booking a UK journey while you’re in the UK. Different booking fees apply if you book a journey in another country (or if you’re in another country when you book).
 We are continually testing changes in our product, which means some customers may have a slightly different experience to others while tests are in place.
 Does Trainline charge any fees to collect tickets or have them delivered?
 If you book through our app, we don’t charge delivery fees for any tickets.
 If you book through our website, we don’t charge delivery fees for digital tickets. We do, however, charge a delivery fee for any tickets sent to you in the post or tickets collected at the station. If you choose for your ticket to be sent by second class post, the delivery fee is £2.75. If you choose for your ticket to be sent by Royal Mail next day delivery, the delivery fee is £8.25. If you choose to collect your ticket at the station, the delivery fee is £1.00.

How do I collect tickets from a self-service ticket machine?
Your tickets will be available to collect from a self-service ticket machine or station ticket office within 15 minutes of making your booking. They can be collected at any time, but you’ll need to make sure you have them with you before you travel.
If you choose to collect your ticket at the station, the delivery fee is £1.00.

For some bookings you'll need to use the card you paid with to collect your tickets.

You can collect your tickets from any UK station with a collection machine, it doesn’t have to be the station you’re travelling from. Search for your preferred station below.

How do I download/activate my Mobile Tickets?
Almost immediately, after you have purchased your mobile ticket will appear on the My Tickets page in the Trainline app. 

Download ticket
You can then Download ticket to view the actual ticket on your device which includes an image of the barcode that will be scanned at the station. You can only download your Mobile Ticket to one device, so make sure you download it to whichever device you’re planning to take with you when you travel.

Activate ticket
You will need to activate your downloaded ticket before travelling, however this should only be done on the day of travel and once you are sure you will be travelling that day. Activating your ticket is irreversible, once it’s been activated it cannot be changed, refunded or moved so we recommend you only activate it just before boarding. Tickets should not be activated before 04.30 am on the day of travel, unless your train leaves before then. 

Activating your ticket is very straight forward all you need to do is open your ticket in you app and you will see a button that  says activate. All you need to do is click that button. 

Move ticket
If you’ve already downloaded the ticket but now are travelling with a different device then you can move it.
Open our app in the device you’d like to move your tickets to. Log in to your trainline account and then download your tickets to your new device.

Extracted Content:
What are digital tickets?
An eticket and Mobile Ticket are two different types of digital ticket. We’ll show you whichever option is available for your route when you book.

Choose these when booking your journey with us and scan them directly from your phone, no need to queue at the station or print.

Book on our app and it’s even easier, as all your tickets are kept in one place.
etickets
An eticket comes as a PDF attached to an email, which you can open directly or forward to another passenger, if you’re booking on their behalf. You can also view your etickets in our app.

How to use an eticket
Open the email we send you with the PDF(s) attached – this is separate to your booking confirmation email
If you like, you can add the eticket(s) to our app or Apple Wallet
Scan the QR code from your phone at the ticket gate at the station, or show to staff

Group bookings

If you’re travelling as a group using etickets, the lead passenger can forward the PDF attachments, so you can each open your ticket on your own device. Groups with etickets that have a GroupSave discount applied must travel together.
Mobile Tickets
Mobile Tickets are just like etickets, except you open them directly in our app and you need to ‘activate’ the ticket before you use it. Mobile Tickets can’t be shared or used on more than one device.

How to use a Mobile Ticket
Open our app and go to My Tickets
Tap your Mobile Ticket to activate it just before you travel – once activated, you can’t request a refund
Scan the QR code from your phone at the ticket gate at the station, or show to staff

Group bookings

Mobile Tickets will be available in the lead passenger’s Trainline app, you can’t share the tickets with the group. You must travel together, regardless of whether you’re using GroupSave discount
sTickets

sTickets are just like eTickets but provide you with a dynamic barcode for extra security and are used to enable us to sell digital season tickets. sTicket seasons can be bought on web and app but can only be used in app.

How to use an sTicket
Open our app and go to My Tickets
Download your season ticket to bind to your device
Tap “View ticket” to create a QR code which can be scanned at the ticket gate at the station, or show to staff
 Digital vs. Paper Tickets
Digital tickets are a convenient, electronic version of your train tickets that you can easily access on your phone or device. On the other hand, paper tickets are printed, and you'll need to bring them along for your trip.

Both types of tickets get you on board, but digital tickets are perfect if you prefer a paperless option that’s always at your fingertips.

Before completing your payment, you'll have the option to choose how you’d like to receive your ticket. You can either collect a paper ticket at the station or have it delivered to your address.

If you’ve already sent out the search party and not found them, you’ll have to buy a new ticket. We can’t offer a refund for a ticket that has been lost as we need proof to process a refund. Why not choose a digital ticket next time?

What if there’s a problem collecting my tickets?
It's never a good idea to leave things 'til the last minute. So, where possible, try and collect your tickets in plenty of time. You can collect them from 15 minutes of making your booking. And remember, you'll need to have your tickets on you when you travel, so you'll need to print them before you hop on the train.

For debit/credit card issues –
For some bookings you'll need to use the card you paid with to collect your tickets. If this card has expired or has been lost, stolen or cancelled you'll need to contact us and we can change your delivery method for you.
If the card needed belongs to someone else, you'll have to get them to collect the tickets for you. If they're unable to do so, you'll have to book another ticket using your own payment card before you catch your train. Learn more about buying tickets for someone else.
If you have paid with a virtual card and are unable to collect the tickets using a physical debit/credit card then please contact us. 
For collection reference issues –
Make sure you're using the correct reference, it's easy to get them mixed up if you have multiple bookings. 
Your collection reference is eight digits long and made up of numbers and letters. If you've got a 10 or 12-digit number, then that's your booking confirmation number, which can't be used to collect tickets. Check your emails or our app for to find your collection reference.
For any other issues, it's best to speak to a member of staff at the train station. If you are looking to change the way you want receive your ticket this can only be done by refunding you ticket. Please visit our refund help page to see if this is possible.

Please note: This is mandatory in order to generate your tickets.

Who needs to provide their API?
All passengers must complete the API form before receiving their tickets for travel. If only 1 passenger has completed the form on a group booking, the tickets will not be available.

API is not needed for children under 4 who travel without a ticket on an adult’s lap. For children under 4 who have a ticket booked, it is required to complete their API too.

What information do I need to provide?
You and every single passenger listed on your booking will need to provide the following information, exactly as it shown on your travel document:
Full name
Date of birth
Gender
Nationality
Travel document type
Travel document number
Travel document country of issue
Travel document expiry date

We will only accept Passport as the type of document. If you don't have a passport and use a national ID card, you will need to complete the API form directly with Eurostar.
When do I need to submit the API?
You will need to provide the API after booking and before travelling in order to collect your tickets or you won’t be able to generate them.
How do I provide the API?
You will need to provide the API from our website, the form won't be available from your app.
 Registered booking:

 Guest booking:
If you made your booking without a trainline account, you can access the form directly from your confirmation email from the Manage booking link or via our Find a booking page.

Please note: The information submitted in the form will not be saved for future journeys, this must be re-entered each time.

I’ve made a typo while filling the API form
Not to worry, you can amend the details in the form as many times as necessary but you need to make sure the passenger name matches the name on your ticket.You can resend the form with the correct information directly on Eurostar website.
I’ve booked before the 1st of April
If your ticket was purchased prior to April 1st for a travel date after that day, there is no requirement for you to provide the API.

Please note: If you want to change the date, you will need to provide the API in order to get your new tickets.
I’ve provided my API but didn’t receive my ticket

How does the multi-currency feature work?
On Trainline you can pay for certain journeys in any of 10 currencies - GBP (£) / US Dollar ($) / Australian Dollar (A$) / Canadian Dollar (C$) / Swiss Franc (CHF) / Swedish Krone (SEK) / Euros (€) Danish Krone (DKK) Norwegian Krone (NOK)Japanese Yen (JPY)
We automatically display the currency that we think is most relevant to you but you can change to your preferred currency
on our website - using our currency switcher dropdown located at the top of the homepage
on our apps - selecting currency in the account settings
on the mobile website - selecting currency from the menu located at the top at the top of the homepage
If you are entitled to a refund and you paid in a currency different from the operator's currency, then any fees that apply to your refund will be calculated in the currency you paid in (and at the exchange rate that applied at the time of purchase).

If you decide to pay using a credit or debit card linked to a bank account set up in a currency different to the one in which you have decided to pay, then you may be subject to any applicable fees chargeable by your bank (for example, commissions) and, in the event that you request a refund, you may be subject to foreign currency fluctuations between the time of ticket purchase and the time of refund.

If you’ve used our save for later feature, the price shown is using the latest exchange rate, this exchange rate may have varied between the time the ticket was locked and when you return to purchase. The price on payment is the full price including any exchange rate changes.

I didn’t receive any tickets but I was still charged
You may have just checked your bank statement or your PayPal account and noticed that there is a still a (pending) charge for a failed payment and/or you have not received your ticket. Don’t worry - here is some information to help.

If after making a booking you didn't receive a confirmation email then we recommend accessing your account in the app or online to check if the booking was successful. If you don't have an account and you're still unsure, please contact us before attempting to book again. 

If the booking was not successful but the transaction attempt shows on your statement then here are some reasons why: 

Credit card payment: Why does this happen? 
Well, in technical speak, we work with an authorisation plus capture method. This is very similar to what many hotels do with deposits: they will authorise your card for the deposit and will only capture it in the event it needs to be paid. Otherwise the funds are released after a short period of time.

We receive your payment information i.e. your credit card details
If your bank is enrolled, you will then have to complete the 3D Secure verification (e.g. enter a code sent by SMS)
Once the 3D Secure verification has been completed, your bank will to let us know if you have sufficient funds available. If you do, your bank will then authorise the transaction. This means they tell us there is enough money on the card and give us the green light to go ahead and debit your account. It is at this point that they have also reserved the amount for us, in case we choose to debit it from your account.
Now we have been authorised to make the charge, we can capture the money. If we do capture it, then your card has been debited. However, if your payment was cancelled or failed due to an error, then it means we do not complete the capture. If you consider the hotel example, it is the same process - if no charge (capture) is made, the money is released.

Sometimes payments fail in between step three and four and that can cause a big misunderstanding. If the transaction appears on your bank statement, do not fret. Some banks show the authorisation on the bank statement (usually in the 'future operations' section or similar). The 'transaction' usually disappears from the statement after a few hours or a few days, depending on the bank.
PayPal payment: Why does this happen ?
When you make a payment with Trainline or any other company online, your PayPal payment is always pending until your order is processed and then the payment is collected. If your reservation fails, then your order also isn’t processed and we do not collect the payment.

The payment will automatically be cancelled from our side. So this will also be reflected in your PayPal account once the cancellation is processed.
Why does the charge still show on my account?
The charge still appears on your bank statement or PayPal account because it is a pending payment. Often, you will even find it listed under the pending payments in your account. If we follow the steps above, we can see it makes sense that the payment is registered as pending. Your bank or PayPal has already been “informed” that we wish to make the charge and have reserved the money for us. However, due to the payment failing or being cancelled, we did not complete the capture and did not make the charge.

What happens now is that your bank just needs to process this and then will release the money on your card. The payment will eventually also be listed as cancelled.
What should I do now?
The best thing to do is wait, generally it takes no longer than a few hours and you'll soon see that the charge hasn’t been made. You can always contact your bank in the meantime for some extra confirmation.

My PayPal payment is not working?
If your PayPal payment is not working it could be due to a variety of reasons.
If you have clicked Continue with PayPal and nothing happens or you only see a blank window, then you most likely have a pop-up blocker installed. This pop-up blocker will block PayPal from opening an additional payment window. So all you need to do is temporarily disable it and then the window can open or load properly.
Your PayPal account is not verified. We currently only accept payments from verified accounts for security reasons. If you would like to verify your account, you can do that here. Please note that it does take several working days to process, so we recommend paying with a credit or debit card instead.
If you cannot log in to your PayPal account, unfortunately there isn’t much we can do. We recommend that you contact PayPal directly and they should hopefully help you very quickly.
If your payment freezes or cannot be processed by PayPal, we recommend that you try again. Yet please be careful to make sure that you have not been charged twice. It is first better to check whether your tickets have been emailed to you or if they visible in your account if you have one. We also recommend checking your PayPal account to see whether the transaction has gone through.

You can of course always contact Trainline and we are happy to help in any way possible.

VAT Invoice/Expense receipts

 This receipt is not a VAT invoice for the total cost of your travel. 
Trainline sells tickets to you on behalf of the Rail and Coach providers and do not charge VAT on your Rail and Coach travel, this is the responsibility of the Rail and Coach providers. 
Where VAT is charged on Rail and Coach travel (usually within the EU), this will either be shown on your ticket or you can obtain an invoice directly from the Rail and Coach provider if you need to recover VAT for your business account. 

Trainline does charge VAT on the booking fees applied, this is shown on your email conformation and the receipt available from the app or website, both can be used as a VAT receipt.
 How do I get an expense receipt
A receipt for proof of payment and/or proof of travel is available from our App or website, following the directions below:

Choose the option ‘Expense receipt’.
An expense receipt will be formatted ready for downloading.

VAT rates vary between EU countries, to see the VAT rate for each EU member state click here.
Why have I paid for my ticket in one currency, but the VAT is showing another currency?
You can choose to pay for your Rail or Coach travel in the currency of your choice. The VAT that is charged will depend on where you travel and will be shown in the currency of the country in which the VAT will be due.
Why do we tell you the companies in the Trainline group on your confirmation receipt?
The Trainline Group has companies in the United Kingdom (“UK”) and France who facilitate booking your tickets in the UK, the European Union (“EU”) and rest of the world (“ROW”).

When you buy a ticket, whether for travel in the UK, EU, ROW, or a combination, it might be a combination of the Trainline companies facilitating those bookings. The receipts you receive need to show the company that sells you the ticket. Rather than sending you lots of receipts for each ticket from our various companies, we have shown all the ticket details on the one email at the bottom to keep things nice and tidy.

Why is my payment being rejected?
If your card’s been rejected, don’t panic. There could be a few of simple reasons why –
Your card may have expired, or you might have typed in the numbers wrong.
You might have selected the wrong card type, or it might be a card type we don’t accept. Check if your card type is accepted.
Your card issuer might have declined the transaction. If you think this could be the reason, contact them for advice.
We put identity verification checks in place to help stop issues like fraud.
It may be a problem with 3D Secure.

We’d suggest trying a different card to make your booking, if this doesn't work contact us here.

Deutsche Bahn - booking failed

If you selected a seat reservation, it could be case that the seat reservation couldn’t be issued.   As soon as the tickets have been selected and paid for via our website, we forward the booking to the route provider's system, which then confirms whether the order was successful or not. 
If the booking failed, you can try to book again without using a seat reservation. Should there still be any issue, please don’t hesitate to get in touch with our customer support team.

How do I buy a ticket for someone else?
You can buy a ticket for someone else to travel with by choosing one of these options –
Mobile Tickets – firstly, the person travelling will need our app. When you book, choose our Mobile Ticket option and just fill out the name of the person travelling, instead of your own. Then, all you need to do is forward the booking confirmation email to that person. They can then tap “Download your mobile ticket” on our app and voila!
etickets – forward the email to the traveller who can open the e-ticket attachment on their phone or print off a paper copy. 
By post – make sure you put the delivery address for the person who’s travelling, instead of your own. Don’t worry, the billing address and delivery address can be different.  
Self-service ticket machine - collection is available from any one of the 1,700 ticket machines in stations across the UK. This is where you use a collection reference number and a debit/credit card to access your tickets and print them. Sometimes you’ll be given the option to collect tickets with any debit/credit card and not necessarily the one which was used in payment. It’s worth checking if this option is available to you on the delivery options screen when you’re booking. If you pay for your tickets using PayPal or Apple Pay then collection with any type of card is guaranteed.

How to check when Off-Peak trains are? 
Unfortunately, there is not one set rule that applies to all Train Operators.  Most Off-Peak tickets are found during weekend travel or through the week outside of commuting hours, but the only way to know for sure is to check an individual journey using our app or website. 
App 
Our app highlights if train times are Off-Peak or Super Off-Peak. If neither is displayed, then it’s a Peak train. 


Website 
Visit our train times page, scroll down to the 'Change' button and enter your journey search for a clear display of what trains are Peak vs Off-Peak vs Super Off-Peak. 


Alternatively, you can search for tickets from our home page by using ‘Get times & tickets’. The types of tickets presented are an indication of if the train is at an Off-Peak or Super-off Peak time.  Click the earlier/later buttons until you find your ideal one.

SplitSave
Splitsave is not available on every journey. When it is available it will show as an option on our app when it is. 

What is SplitSave?
SplitSave is our latest feature available on our mobile app that makes split ticketing easy! Split ticketing is a way of saving money on train travel by ‘splitting’ your trip into multiple tickets. There’s a common misconception that split ticketing is all about changing trains, but that’s not the case. Actually, it’s the same journey, just more tickets than usual.

SplitSave finds clever combinations of tickets to save you money on thousands of journeys across the UK – all you have to do is show different tickets along your journey.

Changing trains…?
SplitSave doesn’t add any additional changes to your route. So, if your journey had no changes originally, there’d still be no changes – hurrah!

If your journey included a change anyway, then this will still apply. Your tickets won’t always ‘split’ at the same point that your train changes though. You can find a detailed breakdown in your Journey Tracker though, so you’re clear.

The only condition when using SplitSave is that the train you take must stop at all the places you’ve bought tickets for and not just pass through them.

How flexible is SplitSave?
If your SplitSave includes at least one Advance Single fare, then you’ll need to take the train you selected. But, if your SplitSave is made up of flexible fares (Anytime, Off-Peak or Super Off-Peak) then you may be able to take different trains, as long as they stop at stations where your tickets ‘split’. And remember, you don’t necessarily have to change trains where your tickets ‘split’.

How does it work out cheaper?
Put simply, it's a quirk of the UK ticketing system

UK ticket prices are based on things like the journey duration, time of travel, and fare flexibility. SplitSave finds the cheapest combo of tickets to make your overall journey cheaper

Is it legit?
Absolutely! You're buying normal tickets, just more of them than usual. It’s the same journey, just multiple tickets.

Can I use railcards?
Absolutely! Just add them as normal when you search to get even cheaper prices.

Can I still reserve a seat?
Yes, if a train operator offers seat reservations, then we’ll do our best to reserve one for you.
In rare cases, you may only be able to reserve a seat for part of your journey. Occasionally, you may have to change seats partway through your journey. Check your ticket for seat-specific info.

How do I apply a GroupSave discount?
GroupSave offers a 1/3 discount when traveling on Off-Peak trains with a group of three to nine people.
When you search for tickets on our website, select the GroupSave option from the Railcard drop-down menu, where it says Add railcard.

Just so you know...
If you book with a GroupSave discount, all the passengers in your group will need to stick together. If your group splits up your tickets won’t be valid anymore.  
Not all of the Train Operating Companies (TOCs) that we work with offer GroupSave discount. But, so long as you select GroupSave when you search for your tickets, we’ll automatically apply the discount if it’s available
Although it's selected from the Railcard menu, it's just a discount and not actually a Railcard. The same rules of having to take proof of a physical Railcard on your trip does not apply.

How do I buy cheap Advance tickets?
Advance tickets are, you guessed it, tickets that are bought in advance. They’re non-refundable Single tickets that are available from 12 weeks before departure, which often makes them cheaper than buying them on the day of travel. Some Train Operating Companies (TOCs) offer Advance tickets for travel on week dates up to 24 weeks in advance.

When the TOCs release Advance Single tickets, they’ll be immediately available to book with us. But, as they’re often in limited supply, they sell out quickly. So, if you find them it’s best to book as soon as possible. You can mix and match two Advance Single tickets to make up a return journey.

Right now, you can find out if there are Advance tickets available for your journey. And, if they’re not, you can sign up to our Ticket Alert and we’ll tell you when they become available.

Sometimes Advance tickets are still available for a route on the date of departure and you can buy these tickets up to two hours before departure. Learn more about how you can save money with Advance tickets on the day.

Two same ticket types have different prices. Why?
When you search for a journey on our website or our app, you might (rarely) find that there are two tickets with the same name, but different costs. Don’t worry, it’s not a bug!

We work with 28 Train Operating Companies (TOCs) and their prices can differ. When you search, we show you all the options available, which might be with different TOCs.

Click on the ticket types to see the terms and conditions. If they’re both the same, you can just pick either ticket to book. We’d go for the cheaper one though, more money for snacks or a coffee at the station.

What are the different tickets available for UK trains?
Each ticket type varies in price and flexibility. Select the ticket type you’re interested in buying for more information.

Advance tickets
Why choose an Advance ticket?
They’re normally the cheapest tickets around. They’re released up to 12 weeks in advance, so tend to be a lot cheaper than a ticket that’s bought on the day of travel. You can buy your ticket up to 18:00 the day before your journey.
Most Advance tickets let you reserve a seat. For long journeys it’s nice to know you’ll have a place to perch.
You can get a discount with a valid Railcard.
Advance tickets give you plenty of time to plan your journey - a good choice for people who like to know exactly what they’re doing.

Just so you know..
Advance tickets are non-refundable.
Advance tickets are only available as Single tickets, but you can combine two Advance Single tickets to make up a return journey.
Advance tickets are released 12 weeks before the travel date and, because they’re often cheap, they can sell out fast.
Advance tickets are for a specific route, date and time, so they’re not flexible. You can’t break your journey either. But, if your plans change, you can make changes to the date or time, subject to the payment up to £10.00 fee per ticket per person and any difference in fares (click here for more info about exchange fees).

Off-Peak/Super Off-Peak
Why choose an Off-Peak/Super Off-Peak ticket?
If you’re flexible with your time of travel, choosing to avoid peak times will save you money as Off-Peak and Super Off-Peak tickets are cheaper than the more flexible Anytime tickets. Plus, you can skip the hustle and bustle of commuter journeys.
Off-Peak and Super Off-Peak tickets can be bought as an Open Return, letting you take your return journey on any Off-Peak or Super Off-Peak train within one month.
If you decide to no longer travel, these tickets can be refunded with fees of up to £10.00 (click here for more info about refund fees).
You can get a discount with a valid Railcard.
Just so you know..
You’ll have to make sure you’re travelling on an Off-Peak or Super Off-Peak train, depending on your ticket. Your ticket won’t be valid during peak times, and you might get charged a fine if you’re stopped by a ticket officer. Check which train times are Off-Peak here
If you know the specific route, date and time you’re planning to travel on, an Advance ticket might be available and is usually cheaper. Why not set up a ticket alert and we’ll tell you when Advance tickets for your route are available.
Anytime
Why choose an Anytime ticket?
This is the most flexible type of ticket available, so if your plans aren’t set in stone this is your best option.
Anytime Single tickets let you travel on any train on the date shown on your ticket up until 04:29 the next morning.
Anytime Return tickets let you travel on any train on the date shown on your ticket, or within the next five days inclusive. You can return at any time within one calendar month.
Anytime Day Single and Anytime Day Return tickets let you travel on any train on the date shown on your ticket, up to 04:29 the next morning.
If you decide to no longer travel, these tickets can be refunded with fees of up to £5 (click here for more info about refund fees).
You can get a discount with a valid Railcard.
Just so you know..
Because of the flexibility they offer, Anytime tickets are more expensive than Off-Peak and Super Off-Peak tickets. Check the train times for your route as you might find your route is Off-Peak, so you could buy a cheaper ticket.

What do I need to know about sleeper services?
Sleepers are long-distance trains that have berths with beds in, so you can get a decent night’s sleep and arrive at your destination feeling refreshed. There are two companies that offer sleeper services – Caledonian Sleeper and Great Western Railway’s Night Riviera service. 

Berth types
You can choose either a berth with a normal seat, or a berth with a bed for your journey. They’re highlighted with icons, so you know what you’re booking. 

Food and drink options
If you’re travelling First Class on the Caledonian Sleeper you’ll get a free continental or hot breakfast, which you can eat in the Lounge Car or have delivered to your room. Room service also covers things like snacks and drinks. Plus, you’ll have the option to pre-book your evening meal.

If you’ve booked a bed in Standard Class, or you’ve just booked a seat option, breakfast, dinner, snacks and drinks are all available to buy in the Lounge Car.

Great Western Railway’s sleeper service offers complimentary breakfast, snacks and non-alcoholic drinks for those who’ve booked a cabin. There’s also an Express Café on board where you can buy food and drink if you’ve just booked a seat.

Pets and bikes
The Caledonian Sleeper lets you take guide dogs on board for free. If you’re travelling on your own in Standard Class, or you’ve only booked a seat option, then pets aren’t allowed, sorry. However, First Class passengers can bring pets into their cabin with them, for a £30.00 fee.

Great Western Railway’s Night Riviera service lets you take guide dogs on board for free. Other pets can travel for free, but they’ll have to travel in a pet carrier in the guard’s van.

Bikes can also be brought on board both services, you’ll just need to reserve a bike space, which is free of charge.

What is an Open Return ticket?
Open Return tickets allow you to be flexible on the train you decide to travel back on. There are two different ways to buy Open Return tickets.
 If you started your search by selecting Return journey you'll be asked to choose which train you want to return on, even if the ticket you select is an Open Return ticket.
  
If you started your search by selecting Open Return then the same ticket will be offered, but you don't need to select the train you want to return on.
 
Why would I choose to select a return date? 
The main benefit of booking a Return, instead of an Open Return is the option of reserving a seat. If you'd like to reserve a seat, search for a Return ticket, if you're not fussed about seat reservations and aren't sure when you're returning, pick an Open Return.

Here are the different types of Open Return tickets available –

Anytime Return - the outward portions of Anytime Returns are valid for five days, including the date on the ticket. You must return within one calendar month of the outward travel date specified. For example, if you bought an Anytime Return for 1st Feb you could wait 'til 5th Feb to make your outward journey.

Anytime Day Return - your outbound and return travel can be on any train on the date specified. For example, if you bought an Anytime Day Return for 1st Feb you would have to take your outward and return journey on 1st Feb.   

Off-Peak Return - your outward journey must be on Off-Peak trains on the date specified, and you must return on Off-Peak trains within one calendar month.

Off-Peak Day Return - your outbound and return journey can be on any Off-Peak train on the date specified.   

Super Off-Peak Return - you can return on any Super Off-Peak train within one calendar month.
If you’re unsure about when you can travel, our Train Times page clearly highlights whether a train is Peak, Off-Peak or Super Off-Peak. 

Please note: Your ticket may be valid on specified operators only.

Railcards and travel restrictions
Generally, all Railcards can be used for discounted train fares during Off-Peak times, weekends, and public holidays. Some, like the age-related Railcards, can be used during Peak times with a minimum fare, and the Disabled Persons Railcard can be used at any time.
 Some Railcards have specific restrictions on the times you can travel. 
 Others can only be used on fares that’re above a certain price, at a certain time. 
 For example, if you’re travelling between 04:30 am and 10:00 am, some Railcards can only be used on fares that cost £12 or more.  
 This is especially important when you buy Anytime tickets or other flexible tickets. If you travel on a train before 10:00 and have used your Railcard to buy your ticket, make sure you didn’t pay less than £12. Your ticket won’t be valid before 10:00 am - even though it's an Anytime ticket. You could be fined! When you search for tickets via Trainline with a Railcard applied, it's best to travel on the train you searched for. If you end up travelling on an earlier train, make sure to double-check any restrictions. 
 The full railcard terms and conditions can be found here.

How can I get a Photocard?
Before buying your Season ticket you need to make sure you have a Photocard to use as ID. 
If you don’t have one you can request one from us by filling in the form attached to this article.  Please note we can only issue adult Photocards.
Alternatively pop into your local train station ticket office with a passport-size photo (approx.. 35mm x 45mm) and they’ll make you one.


Where required, your Photocard number must be on your Season ticket. For your Season ticket to be valid, you must show both your Season ticket and Photocard with matching numbers if requested by rail staff. Failure to provide a Photocard with your Season ticket when requested may result in being charged for a day ticket or a penalty fare.

Digital Railcards
Buying a Digital Railcard
Types of Digital Railcard with Trainline
You can now buy the following digital Railcards with us and store them directly in your Trainline app.

Railcards by age
Age-based Railcards are great for students, young professionals and seniors.
16-17 Saver
16-25 Railcard
26-30 Railcard
Senior Railcard (60+)
Railcards by Group
Railcards are great for friends, couples and family members. You don't need to be related or in a relationship to use them. They're a good option for anyone aged 31-59 who doesn't qualify for an age-based Railcard and also offer discounts on child fares.
Family & Friends Railcard
Two Together Railcard
Railcard by region
Lets you explore the Network Railcard area — 16 counties across the South East, including London — for 1/3 less.
Network Railcard
 Please note that the Disabled Persons Railcard and Veterans Railcard are not available to buy digitally with us. We are currently working on the ability to verify eligibility.  If you already have this type of Railcard you can still buy discounted train tickets through trainline. 

Make sure you have a compatible device
You need the trainline app and iOS 13.4 and above or Lollipop on Android.

Can I buy more than one Railcard?
You can have more than one Railcard, but for now you’ll have to buy them in separate transactions.

I no longer want the Digital Railcard
Railcards can be refunded within 14 days of purchase as long as they haven’t been used to buy discounted tickets. Please contact us to request a refund. 
Please note: If you have downloaded your Railcard, this can no longer be refunded

Viewing Digital Railcard in app
Can one railcard be shown on multiple devices?
The Railcard is associated to only the email address it was purchased under and so it can be shown on any trainline app that is logged in with that email address - you can log into more than one device with the same email address.
Two Together Railcard and Family & Friends Railcard both have more than one cardholder, however the Railcard is still associated to only the purchasing email address and so can only viewed through that one login.

I bought a Railcard on Trainline, but now I can’t find it in the app.

To view your Railcard in the app, you'll need to first log in to your account with the same email address you purchased with. After logging in, navigate to the Account tab and tap on "Your Railcards" to bring up the list of Railcards you've purchased. Then tap on "Download Railcard" to download it to your device.

I bought a Railcard for someone else
The Digital Railcard photo must be that of the persons who are going to use it for travel. The Railcard will only show in the app if logged in with the same email address as purchased. To move the Railcard to a different email address entirely then please contact us. 


Using the Digital Railcard for travel
Can I buy a Railcard and apply the discount within the same booking?
Not at the moment, but we’re working on it. For now, you can buy your Railcard in one transaction and then book your train tickets straight afterwards in a separate transaction. To apply the discount, select the Railcard manually from the search screen.


Can I apply more than one Railcard to my booking?
Yes, but only up to the same number of passengers on the booking. You can use any Railcards in combination with each other. Whether the discount is applied or not depends on the ticket type you select.

Some Railcards will offer discounts for the people you’re travelling with too, so you may only need one Railcard between you.

How do I apply a Railcard discount?
Select where you’re travelling from and to and the date and time you'd like to travel.
Add your passengers and their relevant Railcards.
Select ‘Get times & tickets’. If you're eligible for a discount, it will automatically be applied to your search results.

Why wasn’t my Railcard discount applied?
Railcards offer you up to 1/3 discount on your train tickets, but discounts won’t be applied in the following scenarios:
The Railcard does not apply to the route you’re travelling on.
For example, the Network Railcard is only valid for journeys in the South East of England.
Railcards are not valid on European journeys (including Eurostar).
If your Railcard discount only applies to Off-Peak travel, but you’re searching for journey that departs during peak times.
The Network Railcard doesn’t offer discount on Advance tickets.

To see the full list of ticket types where a Railcard discount is not valid, click here.

Can I apply a Railcard discount retrospectively?
No. Please double check your Railcard discount has been applied before booking your tickets.

Using a Two Together Railcard
When can I use a Two Together Railcard?
A Two Together Railcard can be used to buy discounted tickets for travel from 09:30 Mondays to Fridays, and at any time on Saturdays, Sundays and Public Holidays. The only time you can't use your Two Together Railcard is at morning peak times, i.e. before 09:30 Monday to Friday.

Who can use a Two Together Railcard? 
Anyone aged 16+ can use a Two Together Railcard – the only requirement is that you must travel together with the other cardholder for the discount to apply. Although it's often thought of as a 'couples Railcard', it's also great for friends, family members, flatmates or colleagues who regularly travel together. 

Can you travel alone with a Two Together Railcard? 
No, you cannot travel alone with the Two Together Railcard – you must travel with the second named adult on your Railcard. The two named cardholders must travel together for the entire journey for the discounted tickets to remain valid. 

Can the Railcard be shown on both travellers devices? 
The Railcard is associated to only the email address it was purchased under and it can be shown on the account holders Trainline App. The Railcard can not be shown on the other cardholders account, but we hope that doesn’t matter as you both need to travel together anyway.

Digital Railcards live on our app
Digital Railcards are added to your Trainline account, so you can access them on any compatible device you travel with. Please be aware that the minimum Operating System (OS) your Railcard would be available on is iOS 13.4 and above or Lollipop on Android. There are no device limits or download codes needed.
